I want to write a blog about my Experience at the deep learning indaba. I will share links with you of what I have posted before, what other people have posted as well, and you can combine all of that to build an original blog post which I will post on medium and my personal blog.   

I will share blogs from previous years but please be careful not to reference events from previous years as if they were in 2025

My main goal is to inspire others, highlight African AI innovation, share key learnings, all while reflecting how the Indaba has shaped/improved / given exposure to what Ai can do and my  growth,

I need it to be in story form so people can relate like i did in my facebook post but still highligh themes, lessons, takeaways

This Year‚Äôs Keynote Speakers:
Verena Rieser, Research Scientist at Google DeepMind: "Whose Gold? Aligning AI with Diverse Views on what‚Äôs Safe, Aligned, and Beneficial"
Date: Monday, 18 Aug 2025
Time: 10:30 - 11:30
Human feedback is often the "gold standard" for AI alignment, but what if this "gold" reflects diverse, even contradictory human values? This keynote explores the technical and ethical challenges of building beneficial AI when values conflict -- not just between individuals, but also within them. My talk advocates for a dual expansion of the AI alignment framework: moving beyond a single, monolithic viewpoint to a plurality of perspectives, and transcending narrow safety and engagement metrics to promote comprehensive human well-being.
Max Welling, Professor at University of Amsterdam, and CTO and Co-Founder <of CuspAI: "How AI could transform the sciences"
Date: Monday, 18 Aug 2025
Time: 16:30 - 17:30
While we are all hearing about the latest Chatbot from OpenAI, Anthropic or Mistral, another "revolution" has been going in the shadows of that: AI4Science. One could argue that we are in the fifth paradigm of scientific discovery, where AI is proving math theorems, solving scientific questions, predicting the weather, and accelerating molecular simulations of molecules such as drugs and materials. Many of society's largest challenges are rooted in materials and a better understanding of molecules through AI assisted computer simulation will help us design the materials we need for better drugs, food production, sustainable energy, and much more. In this presentation I will argue how and why AI can help transform the physical sciences.
Sanmi Koyejo, Assistant Professor at Stanford University, and President of Black in AI: ‚ÄúBeyond Benchmarks: Building a Science of AI Measurement‚Äù
Date: Tuesday, 19 Aug 2025
Time: 09:00 - 10:00
The widespread deployment of AI systems in critical domains demands more rigorous approaches to evaluating their capabilities and safety. While current evaluation practices rely on static benchmarks, these methods face fundamental efficiency, reliability, and real-world relevance challenges. This talk presents a path toward a measurement framework that bridges established measurement science principles with modern AI evaluation needs. We demonstrate how techniques from Item Response Theory, amortized computation, and predictability analysis can substantially improve the rigor and efficiency of AI evaluation. Through case studies in safety assessment and capability measurement, we show how this approach can enable more reliable, scalable, and meaningful evaluation of AI systems. This work points toward a broader vision: evolving AI evaluation from a collection of benchmarks into a rigorous measurement science that can effectively guide research, deployment, and policy decisions.
Dina Machuve, Co-founder and CTO of DevData Analytics: "End-to-End Deep Learning for Chicken Diseases Diagnosis"
Date: Friday, 22 Aug 2025
Time: 14:30 - 15:30
Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are successful in practical applications including disease diagnostics. Coccidiosis, Salmonella, and Newcastle are the common poultry diseases that curtail chicken production if they are not detected early. In Tanzania, these diseases are not detected early due to limited access to agricultural support services by chicken farmers. One field extension officer in Tanzania serves 1,500 smallholder farmers per year. This work demonstrates the application of deep learning to develop a practical diagnostics tool for chicken diseases for use by smallholder farmers and extension officers. The end-to-end deep CNN workflow for chicken diseases diagnosis covers the dataset generation, annotation, modeling and deployment. The dataset comprises of 1,255 laboratory-labeled chicken fecal images and 6,812 fecal images annotated by extension officers. We trained models for image classification tasks using different deep CNN architectures of VGG16, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, Xception models and Vision transformers. We further trained a model using YOLOv8 for object detection tasks. In order to educate farmers and provide farm-advisory service, we developed a question answering model. The deployment challenges at farm level in low resource settings are covered and the potential of Multimodal machine learning in this work.
AI Policy in Africa Panel keynote Discussion
The panel discussion will focus AI Policy and national AI strategies, emphasising the African Union's recent strategic policy statement. The flagship panel discussion is aimed to enhance both regional and global collaboration, positioning Africa as a leader in the development of inclusive and responsible AI. The panel will compare and contrast African strategies with AI policies in the global north.
Date: Wednesday, 20 Aug 2025
Time: 18:00 - 19:15
Moderator: Jane Munga, Fellow, Africa Program, at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
Panelists:
Rayid Ghan, (Machine Learning for Public Good) ‚Äì Professor at Carnegie Mellon University, former Obama Campaign Chief Scientist, founder of Data Science for Social Good
Virginia Dignum, (AI Ethics, Global Standards, EU AI Act) ‚Äì Professor at Umea University, EU AI Act contributor, UNESCO counsellor
Vukosi Marivate, (African-Led AI Research & Data Sovereignty) -‚Äì Chair of Data Science at the University of Pretoria, Lelapa AI co-founder
Additionally, this panel will convey a pre-recorded message from AU commissioner for Infrastructure and Energy, H.E. Ms. Lerato Mataboge, highlighting the AU‚Äôs current AI policy priorities and the significance of the Deep Learning Indaba in convening AI experts from across the continent to build Africa‚Äôs AI capacity and capability.
Tutorials
Tutorials provide in-depth exploration of specific topics within AI and machine learning. These sessions are designed to equip attendees with detailed knowledge and practical skills through structured, guided instruction. Participants will engage with experts to learn advanced techniques and methodologies, enhancing their understanding and capabilities in the field.
There are three parallel tutorial sessions on Sunday and Monday.
Date: Sunday, 17 Aug 2025
Time: 15:00 - 16:00
Exauc√© Luweh Adjim Ngarti: "Introduction to Deep Generative Models"
From generating realistic human faces to improving weather forecasts and enhancing scientific simulations, generative models are driving many of the most exciting advances in artificial intelligence today. But what principles enable these models to learn how to create new data? In this beginner-friendly session, we will explore both the intuition and the mathematical foundations of generative models, with no prior background required. Starting from the basic idea of modeling probability distributions, we will gradually build up the core concepts needed to understand major families of generative models, including GANs, VAEs, autoregressive models, normalizing flows, and diffusion models. The presentation is designed to be accessible yet rigorous, offering intuitive explanations, key insights from recent research, and mathematical clarity. Participants who are new to the topic will gain a clear and structured introduction, while those already familiar with these models will find opportunities for deeper discussion and reflection. This talk also serves as a gateway to future sessions where we will explore each model in greater detail through practical examples and hands-on demonstrations.
Ismaila Seck, and Geraud Nangue Tasse: "Mathematics of Deep Learning"
This tutorial provides a foundational introduction to the core mathematical concepts underpinning modern deep learning. Aimed at early-stage practitioners and researchers, it emphasizes the importance of mathematical fluency for understanding, applying, and innovating with machine learning techniques. The tutorial is structured in two main parts: (1) Linear Algebra, covering vectors, matrices, vector spaces, norms, and matrix operations with practical insights into their role in neural network computations; and (2) Vector Calculus, introducing differentiation of scalars and vectors, with a focus on gradients, Jacobians, and optimization via gradient descent. Throughout, the tutorial draws from visual intuition and practical examples to build deep conceptual understanding essential for advancing in the field.
Speaker Name: "session title"
Date: Monday, 19 Aug 2025
Time: 12:00 - 13:00
Luis Serrano: "Large Language Models: The celestial mechanics of Attention Mechanism"
In this tutorial we'll go over the whole architecture of transformer models, including tokenization, embeddings, positional encoding, feedforward, softmax, and the attention mechanism. The attention mechanism will be developed in detail, including the role of the Key, Query, and Value matrices, and how they help find the similarity between two words. Very little mathematical and machine learning background is required, as the ideas will be developed from scratch, and in a fun visual way with lots of relatable examples.
Arnu Pretorius: "Reinforcement Learning: The Intuition Behind Policy Gradients"
Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven key breakthroughs in recent years, from achieving super-human performance in complex games to aligning large language models. In this tutorial, we'll go over the fundamentals of RL to provide a clear, conceptual understanding of how these powerful systems work. We'll explore the core concepts of agents, environments, and rewards, with a special focus on the central idea of a policy; the agent's strategy for making decisions. By focusing on intuition rather than math, you'll leave with a solid grasp of this key RL concept and how it's used to solve complex problems. No prior knowledge is required.
Yousra Farhani: "Exploring the future of Quantum Computing"
As we stand at the edge of a technological revolution, quantum computing emerges not just as a tool of the future, but as a force redefining it. This talk invites you on a journey beyond the limits of classical computation into the strange and powerful realm of qubits, entanglement, and quantum parallelism. We'll explore how quantum computing is poised to transform how we perform computations and what challenges still lie ahead. Along the way, we‚Äôll dive into the race for quantum potential advantage, the rise of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, and the democratization of quantum education and access. Whether you're a curious learner or a seasoned technologist, this session will spark your imagination and provide a glimpse into the quantum-powered future we're building today.

Centring Data in African AI
Over the past year, data moats have received significant attention, as data is increasingly viewed as a differentiator in AI development. This should be unsurprising ‚Äì data is central to deep learning. Despite this, research on data in AI often receives far less attention than work on algorithms and architectures. For the African AI community, research on data and the broader AI data ecosystem are particularly important. On the one hand, data for African contexts is often scarce, expensive to create and difficult to access. This necessitates technical innovations in dataset development, model training and evaluation. On the other hand, data collection, governance, and ownership present several socio-technical challenges, including tensions between inclusion and appropriation, sovereignty and cultural erasure, as well as participation and control. This workshop, Centring Data in African AI, explores the challenges and opportunities of data in African AI from technical and socio-technical perspectives. Key technical topics include dataset measurement, fit-for-purpose evaluation data, small model development, and model customisation and personalisation. Relevant socio-technical topics include, but are not limited to, participation and inclusion, representation and autonomy, compensation and control, licensing, data sharing, and the role of human labour in data work.

Responsible AI: from Africa to the World
The grassroots AI research conducted across Africa, supported by Deep Learning Indaba, changes the rules of the game in global AI research. While AI research efforts in the Global North tend to focus on the publication of academic papers and the increase of productivity, the AI research trajectory in the continent is contributing to both fundamental AI state of the art and the needs of local communities. This is partly due to the community-based engagements focusing on specific research areas such as NLP, Computer Vision, Geospatial ML. However, there is a gap where the research outputs from the continent are not warmly welcomed at global scientific venues. There are growing efforts to address the gap, such as special issues and hosting top AI conferences in the continent, e.g., ICLR 2023 and MICCAI 2024. This workshop aims to generate a discussion and build bridges between the unique AI research agenda across Africa and the international AI key stakeholders, to learn about Responsible AI from Africa to the world.

The NeuroAI Workshop at the Deep Learning Indaba 2025
Computational neuroscience seeks to understand brain function through mathematical models and simulations. In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), the integration of computational neuroscience and machine learning presents a frontier rich with potential for groundbreaking advancements. Artificial intelligence can help us deepen our understanding of the brain and by examining how the brain processes information. Therefore we can develop more robust and efficient AI systems based on how the brain works. Despite the significant contributions of computational neuroscience to understanding the brain and behaviour, Africa contributes less than 2% to global computational neuroscience research. The NeuroAI workshop aims to explore the interest in computational neuroscience in the African AI community, including both students and professionals, through the Deep Learning Indaba (DLI). The workshop will review various topics at the intersection of neuroscience and AI, including the cognitive foundation of learning algorithms, emphasising neural representations and biologically plausible learning systems, and AI‚Äôs application in decoding and analysing neuroscience data. After organizing the first workshop at DLI 2024, many participants expressed a strong interest in the field and a desire to deepen their knowledge and skills. Additionally, we received feedback from several attendees who were eager to access materials that would help them build a solid foundation in this area. We are optimistic that a second edition of the NeuroAI workshop will build on our previous progress by continuing to sow the seeds of interest and establish the burgeoning field of NeuroAI within the DLI community and Africa as a whole. It will also allow NeuroAI researchers to share their work with people with similar interests. Through a series of talks and interactive sessions from experts in computational neuroscience, the workshop aims to encourage participants to investigate how these two fields can complement each other. The NeuroAI workshop will spark international collaborations to ensure that the global south is not excluded from groundbreaking applications of AI ranging from basic neuroscience research to the development of neurotechnologies and neural interfaces that will mark future decades.

Hackathon
There are two hackathons planned for this year‚Äôs Indaba.
Instadeep Hackathon
Hack the Carbon: Monitoring Africa‚Äôs Forest Biomass from Space
Africa‚Äôs forests are among the planet‚Äôs most efficient carbon sinks, yet they can rapidly turn into major carbon sources when cleared, burned or degraded. Quantifying above-ground biomass (AGB) is therefore essential for national carbon accounting, REDD+ reporting and evidence-based conservation policies.
This hackathon challenges participants to build and benchmark machine-learning models that estimate forest biomass across the African continent using open-source multispectral imagery, in-situ plot measurements and ESA‚Äôs Climate Change Initiative (CCI) biomass products. Teams will receive curated training data and baseline code, then race to (1) derive robust AGB estimates at 30 m resolution, (2) build a tool for monitoring spatio-temporal biomass change, and (3) quantify model uncertainty for policy use (optional).
Winners will be judged on predictive accuracy, computational efficiency and clarity of insight. Whether you are a remote-sensing specialist, data scientist or climate advocate, join us in ‚Äúhacking the carbon‚Äù to track Africa‚Äôs forest health and inform the next generation of climate solutions.

From AI and machine learning to quad biking on Mount Kigali, my Rwanda trip was everything I didn‚Äôt know I needed! 
When I landed in Rwanda, my mind was set on one thing, attending the Deep Learning Indaba. This annual gathering of Africa‚Äôs brightest minds in AI and machine learning was a dream come true.
But what I didn‚Äôt realize was that Kigali had so many more surprises waiting for me. 
The Indaba itself was magical, conversations with people from across Africa flowed effortlessly and turned into friendships I‚Äôll treasure forever. I walked away with knowledge and a community that feels like home.
But oh, Kigali had SO much more in store for me! 
 At Fazenda Sengha, perched on Mount Kigali, I unleashed my adventurous side. I did horseback riding, archery  (and apparently I‚Äôm so good at it ), zip lines , quad biking. One afternoon felt like an entire adventure park!
 I wandered through the Niyo Arts Centre, where local creativity really stood out.
 The Genocide Memorial was a sobering and emotional stop. Standing there, I felt the weight of history but also the incredible strength of Rwanda‚Äôs journey toward freedom, unity, and hope.
 Moving around on motorbikes became one of my favorite thrills, the city truly feels different when you‚Äôre moving around with the wind in your face.
 Biryogo Car-Free Zone was foodie heaven,  street vibes, delicious meals, laughter all around. And because Rwanda is so safe, you would literally seee  families even with toddlers having meals at 11 pm.
 At night, the Kigali Convention Centre Dome glowed in colors that made it feel almost magical. And yes, I tasted what might just be the best passionfruit ice cream of my life from Delizia Italiana.
 My food adventures didn‚Äôt stop,  I tried out new restaurants, and even had authentic Nigerian food with an Amstel Malta (because what‚Äôs a Naija meal without that classic malt drink? ).
 Being in front of the Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani Hand was surreal, an iconic landmark that feels larger than life.
 And then there was Kigali Universe, the ultimate rooftop playground. I did bowling with friends from Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Senegal and even watched a live boxing match. Tried the famous bull ride experience , it was the perfect mix of thrill and friendship.
Every moment in Kigali felt like a new chapter of joy and discovery.
From the adrenaline highs to the quiet moments of learning, this city gave me an experience I‚Äôll never forget. Kigali, you were vibrant, humbling, delicious, adventurous, and everything in between.
Until next time,  Murakoze Rwanda!  #DLI2025

Leaving home
At the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos, I rolled my bag through the departure hall, half excited, half nervous. My heart raced, this was it, my FIRST INDABA!

I checked in at the counter, dropped off my luggage, and collected my boarding pass. Security took a little while, but once I got through, I felt a sense of relief. At the boarding gate, I met a few other Indaba attendees. We quickly bonded, sharing small conversations and laughter while waiting to board.

The Flight
Inside the plane, I found my seat and settled in. The take-off gave me butterflies, but after a while, I got comfortable. The food was not as terrible as I had expected. I spent part of the flight looking out the window, watching the clouds drift by, and thinking about what was ahead in Rwanda.

Midnight Landing
After 5 hours in the air, we finally touched down in Rwanda. I was struck by how breathtakingly beautiful the city looked. But nothing prepared me for the weather. Back home, the air sits warm between 22‚Äì29¬∞C, but here the temperature dipped to 16‚Äì23¬∞C, and at night, sometimes as low as 15¬∞C. It caught me off guard, within minutes I found myself freezing. I wore a cardigan, pulled on socks, but it didn‚Äôt hold. The cold still found its way in, leaving me shivering and laughing at myself. Cardigan and socks?Betrayal!!!

The accommodation was‚Ä¶ fine. Nothing fancy, but simple and clean. I collapsed into bed, my mind still processing the reality of being here.
And somewhere in all of this, I met the person who would become my roommate for the week. I‚Äôll talk more about her later in this story, but let‚Äôs just say, sharing that room added a whole new layer to my Indaba experience.

Day 1
The first day was all about settling in and registration. One of the fun activities was Bingo Networking. Instead of the usual awkward introductions, Indaba gave each of us a Bingo card in our welcome pack. The card had 25 challenges like ‚Äúfind someone from a different country‚Äù, ‚Äúmeet someone who works on healthcare,‚Äù or ‚Äútalk to someone presenting a poster.‚Äù The goal was to complete 25 challenges in a row vertically, horizontally. If you managed to do that, your card would go into a raffle, and the winner would be announced at the awards ceremony.

It was simple, but it worked. Within minutes, people were walking up to strangers, asking questions, and laughing. I didn‚Äôt have a Bingo card since I couldn‚Äôt complete my registration. Still, people kept walking up to me, eager to connect. The first person was from Kenya, then came someone from Swaziland, and then others followed. Each conversation was a chance to learn a word or two in a new language, and before I knew it, I was already immersed in the spirit of Indaba.

That afternoon, I attended my first sessions, The Mathematics of Deep Learning and Deep Learning Foundations. Concepts like algebra, calculus, and probability help us understand how machines learn from data. The second session gave us the basics of deep learning itself, how neural networks work and why they are useful for solving real problems. From the start, I could tell this was not going to be a passive conference. Indaba was going to make us think, question, and connect.

The Party That Wasn‚Äôt
The opening party was supposed to be our grand welcome to Indaba. Outdoor party with colorful cultural displays and the hum of networking. Chauffeurs circulated, asking for our choice of drinks, while everyone laughed, chatted, and soaked in the atmosphere. We‚Äôd barely gotten through the first round of introductions when the sky opened up. It RAINED and according to the locals, this was unusual for the season.

Day 2
The second day started with the opening remark by the Indaba Chair. They walked us through the story of Indaba: how it began, why it matters, and the different countries that have hosted it over the years.

Next was the welcome remark by the Vice Chancellor of the University of Rwanda, the host university. His words were warm and encouraging, reminding us how important education, research, and collaboration are for Africa‚Äôs future.

The morning continued with two inspiring keynotes: Verena Rieser from Google DeepMind on ‚ÄúAligning AI with Diverse Views‚Äù, and Max Welling from CuspAI on ‚ÄúHow AI Could Transform the Sciences‚Äù.

In the afternoon, I joined the tutorial on Large Language Models (LLMs) with Tejumade Afonja, Annie Qurat Ul Ain, and Jabez Magomere. We compared tokenizers in different languages (I used my local language Ibibio for this test), and then trained a small language model ourselves. LLMs are AI systems trained on huge amounts of data so they can understand and generate human-like language. Tools like ChatGPT are built on them.

We also listened to Max Welling‚Äôs keynote on How AI Could Transform the Sciences. Instead of talking about popular chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini, he focused on what he called the ‚Äúquiet revolution‚Äù of AI for science. He explained that we may be entering a fifth era of scientific discovery, one where AI can prove theorems, predict weather, speed up molecular simulations, and even help design new drugs, materials, and clean energy solutions.

Day 3: Research and Community Day
It was focused on research and community work across Africa. The keynote by Sanmi Koyejo (Stanford University) on ‚ÄúBeyond Benchmarks: Building a Science of AI Measurement‚Äù set the tone.

We then had the Research in Africa showcase with spotlight talks, panels, and startup sessions. The day also featured community challenge finalists, funding discussions, and ended with Ideathon presentations.
Again, it rained and according to the locals, this was unusual for the season.

Day 4 began with the AI Policy in Africa Panel Discussion, where experts like Rayid Ghani, Virginia Dignum, and Vukosi Marivate (moderated by Jane Munga) discussed the African Union‚Äôs continental AI strategy and policy directions. It was eye-opening to hear how Africa is shaping its AI future from a policy perspective.

The highlight for me was the Poster Presentations. I presented my poster on Efik, focusing on how local African languages like Efik can be better represented in AI research and natural language processing. Many researchers stopped by my poster, and I had engaging conversations about the challenges of underrepresented languages in AI, data scarcity, and the opportunities to preserve culture through technology. Their feedback was encouraging and gave me new ideas on how to expand my work.

The day ended with the Culture Dinner. Everyone came in their cultural attire, waving their country flags with pride. It was a colorful, joyful night filled with food, music, and celebrating Africa‚Äôs rich diversity.

Day 5: Lightning Talk
It was truly special for me. I had the opportunity to present my lightning talk on ‚ÄúDid AI Get It Right? A Case Study of AI and Media-Reported Cases of Flood in Nigeria.‚Äù Standing on that stage and sharing my work felt surreal because floods in Nigeria are not just statistics, they are painful realities. In 2024 alone, thousands of families in Benue and Anambra were displaced as raging waters swept through their homes, destroying farmlands and cutting off communities from essential services. Lives were lost, livelihoods vanished overnight, and schools were turned into makeshift camps for the displaced. As I presented, I wanted the audience to feel that devastation to see beyond the numbers and truly understand the human cost of flooding.

What made it even more rewarding was the interaction afterwards.

Day 6
I missed the early morning mentorship at 6 a.m. (again, coldüòÖ), but I made it to the NLP workshop. The session was powerful, touching on courage, strength, weakness, and the importance of building AI for our local languages. The panel ‚ÄúWe Belong to the Local Language‚Äù really struck a chord with me.

NLP Workshop and exploring the city of Kigali
Later, the adventurer in me took over. I stepped out to explore Kigali, visiting the ALU campus and the stunning Kigali Convention Center. The city has such a vibrant feel, it was refreshing to take it all in.

Closing Party üéâüíÉüèΩ
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever danced that much in my life! The energy was contagious. Josh even took time to teach me a bunch of new dance steps, and trust me, I did my best to keep up. It was the perfect way to wrap up an unforgettable Indaba. But honestly, the best part of the indaba wasn‚Äôt the places, it was the people. I met so many amazing folks from different countries, each working on brilliant projects.

I also visited different booth Google, Google DeepMind, InstaDeep, and a few others. This interactions allowed me to explore new opportunities. Oh, and I even won a Rubik‚Äôs cube at one of the booth.

And of course, the food. This is a snippet of what I ate during Indaba. I got to try some new fruits I had never seen before, and honestly, Kigali‚Äôs flavors did not disappoint.

food by Indaba
I am deeply grateful to my family and friends whose love and encouragement carried me through this journey. You reminded me, time and again, that even the toughest roads can be walked with courage when you have the right people by your side. I carry your love with me wherever I go.

A special note of gratitude goes to Dr. Idara who helped made the experience lighter and truly unforgettable. To the entire Indaba team, thank you for building a stronger African AI community. This experience will stay with me for a very long time.

The food on the flight back home was‚Ä¶ disappointing, to say the least. They served pasta which I don‚Äôt like. Honestly, I couldn‚Äôt understand who thought this was a good idea, so most of it stayed on my tray untouched!

This was my first time applying, and when I was selected, I felt a rush of joy and disbelief. Application for deep learning indaba are expected to open in February 2026, with official details to be announced by the organizers. I‚Äôll be keeping an eye on their updates, and I encourage anyone passionate about AI in Africa to do the same.

Picture this: a young AI enthusiast, laptop perpetually overheating from running neural networks, finally setting foot in Kigali, Rwanda, the city of a thousand hills, for the Deep Learning Indaba, Africa‚Äôs grandest AI conference. After years of dreaming, applying, and one near-miss in 2024 (thanks, travel funding gremlins), I made it to the University of Rwanda in 2025. What followed was a whirlwind of learning, networking, cultural immersion, and a touch of archery-induced adrenaline. Here‚Äôs my story, a blend of geeky triumphs, human connections, and a few moments of ‚ÄúWow, I‚Äôm really here!‚Äù

The Long Road to Kigali
My Indaba journey began in 2021, back when my AI knowledge was more ‚Äúaspiring‚Äù than ‚Äúinspiring.‚Äù I applied year after year, only to face the heartbreak of rejection or, in 2024, the agony of an acceptance thwarted by an empty travel budget. But I‚Äôm not one to sulk. I doubled down, diving into the AI community like a kid into a ball pit. I volunteered at tech events, engaged with the ML Collective, attended local AI conferences, and produced research as if it were my day job. By late 2024, I had two published papers to my name and a third paper presented at an international conference. Not too shabby for someone who once thought ‚Äúoverfitting‚Äù was just a gym term.

This year, I went all-in on my Indaba application, throwing everything but the kitchen sink at it. I applied as an attendee, submitted two research papers ‚Äî one on Graph Neural Networks for minimizing power loss in grid networks and another on few-shot learning for multi-disease blood smear image classification (a love letter to my ML Collective roots) ‚Äî and tossed in a dataset for good measure. The result? My Nollywood Movie Dataset earned a lightning talk and a poster presentation, and my few-shot learning paper snagged a poster slot. The papers didn‚Äôt make the publication cut, but I wasn‚Äôt fazed. I packed my bags, practiced my poster pitch in front of my mirror, and jetted off to Kigali, ready for an adventure.

Kigali: Where Hills and Ideas Collide
Landing in Kigali felt like stepping into a postcard. The city‚Äôs rolling hills and vibrant energy were the perfect backdrop for a conference that promised to blend cutting-edge AI with African innovation. The Indaba kicked off with a Sunday opening party that was nothing short of magical. Rwandan cultural performances ‚Äî complete with traditional dances and music ‚Äî had me grinning like a kid in a candy store. I may have attempted a dance move or two, but let‚Äôs just say my neural networks are better at learning than my feet are at dancing.

Day one dove straight into the good stuff: a tutorial on the mathematics and foundations of machine learning. It was like a warm-up for my brain, complete with hands-on coding sessions that had me scribbling notes faster than my laptop could compile. The real highlight, though, was Monday‚Äôs keynote by Prof. Verena Rieser. She tackled the thorny issues of AI safety, alignment, and societal benefit with a clarity that made me want to stand up and applaud (I didn‚Äôt, but my inner fanboy was cheering). Her talk was a reminder that AI isn‚Äôt just about fancy algorithms ‚Äî it‚Äôs about building tools that serve humanity, especially in a world as diverse as ours.


One of the Indaba‚Äôs superpowers is its ability to spark connections that feel like fate. Enter Prof. Ulrich Paquet, director of the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) in South Africa and a co-founder of the Deep Learning Indaba. Meeting him was a pinch-me moment, especially since I‚Äôd recently been awarded the Google DeepMind Scholarship to pursue my Master‚Äôs in Mathematical Science at AIMS South Africa, focusing on AI for Science. We discussed research, the future of AI in Africa, and my upcoming journey to AIMS. Prof. Paquet‚Äôs warmth and enthusiasm made it feel like a conversation between old friends.

Tuesday was my moment in the spotlight, well, a lightning talk spotlight, at least. I presented my Nollywood Movie Dataset, a labor of love compiling metadata from over 7,200 Nigerian films. Nigeria‚Äôs movie industry, affectionately dubbed Nollywood, is the world‚Äôs second-largest by volume, yet it‚Äôs hampered by a lack of centralized data, like a box office or movie registry. My talk highlighted how this fragmentation holds back an industry brimming with potential. I also showcased a movie recommender system I built using the dataset, which sparked lively discussions about data accessibility, industry analysis, and AI‚Äôs role in boosting Nollywood‚Äôs global presence. The audience‚Äôs questions were sharp, and I left the stage buzzing with ideas (and maybe a little adrenaline).


On Wednesday, I had the exciting opportunity to present my posters at the conference, showcasing two innovative research projects. The first focused on the Nollywood Movie Dataset, while the second centered on few-shot multi-disease classification in blood smear images. For the latter, my team and I conducted an in-depth benchmarking of four prominent few-shot learning techniques. These methods were rigorously evaluated for their ability to accurately detect and classify multiple diseases from limited blood smear samples.

The poster session was incredibly rewarding. Both posters generated engaging discussions with attendees, including researchers, clinicians, and industry experts. I received valuable feedback and suggestions for improved model performance. This inspired me to refine my work, and I‚Äôm eager to implement these insights in future iterations, potentially leading to more robust and deployable solutions. To add to the experience, the closing ceremony recognized both posters for their innovation and impact, awarding us prizes. The experience reinforced the collaborative spirit of the scientific community and left me energized for future work.

One unexpected gift from the Indaba was a newfound passion for reinforcement learning (RL), ignited by the conference‚Äôs workshops, keynotes, and hallway conversations. The sessions peeled back the curtain on RL‚Äôs potential to solve complex, real-world problems, from robots navigating chaotic environments to systems learning from limited data. I found myself captivated by four key research areas: transferring RL from simulations to real-world robots, tackling dataset drift in offline reinforcement learning, mastering multi-task learning to juggle diverse objectives, and designing efficient, scalable multi-agent RL systems. These ideas felt like a treasure map, guiding me toward my next research adventure.

My Indaba experience was a tapestry of moments, intellectual highs, human connections, and a few goofy dance moves. It reminded me why I fell in love with AI in the first place: it‚Äôs a field where curiosity meets impact, where a dataset about Nollywood movies or a model for blood smear analysis can spark change. I left Kigali with a full notebook, a fuller heart, and a renewed fire to push the boundaries of AI in Africa. Here‚Äôs to the next Indaba in Nigeria.

A Heartfelt Thank You
None of this would have been possible without the incredible support of the ML Collective community. Through their tireless fundraising efforts, they raised the funds to cover my travel and accommodation to the Indaba, ensuring that I and other African researchers could seize this opportunity. Their belief in us and commitment to advancing AI in Africa made this dream a reality, and I‚Äôm endlessly grateful for their generosity and spirit.

Deep Learning Indaba is an annual event that gathers more than 350 African machine learning enthusiasts for one week to reinforce the African ML community and help bring future shapers of African AI together. The event is a mixture of conferences, panels, keynotes, workshops, poster sessions, and many interesting activities with diverse topics and rich content.

After having been organised in Southern and East Africa before (South Africa and Kenya). This year‚Äôs edition of 2022 took place for the first time in North Africa ‚Äî Tunisia, under the theme of ‚ÄúMasirouna‚Äù which means our destiny in Arabic.

We were bewildered by the impressive community of AI researchers and practitioners that were present, as well as the brilliant content presented at the various conferences. We learned a wide range of new things during the meeting and made some great friends along the way!

The event started on 21st August and lasted until 26th August. There were plenty of topics and diverse activities which made the event an absolute value-giving experience. Some of the activities of this year‚Äôs agenda were:

CODING AND PRACTICAL SESSIONS
Introduction to ML using Jax
In this session, we learned about JAX and its core concepts, such as automatic differentiation (Grad), parallelization (pmap), vectorization (vmap), just-in-time compilation (JIT), and more. We implemented Linear Regression effectively and learned some of the fundamentals of optimization.

Array Algebra
W gained an intuition about multidimensional arrays (‚Äútensors‚Äù), to better understand transposing, broadcasting, contraction, and the other ‚Äúalgebraic moves‚Äù that make array programming both frustrating and rewarding.

Reinforcement Learning
We learned about Reinforcement Learning, a type of Machine Learning where an agent learns to choose actions in an environment that lead to maximal reward in the long run. RL has seen tremendous success on a wide range of challenging problems such as learning to play complex video games like Atari, StarCraft II and Dota II. In that introductory workshop, we solved the classic Cart Pole environment, where an agent must learn to balance a pole on a cart, using several different RL approaches.

Graph Neural Networks
We learned about Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a topic which has exploded in popularity in both research and industry. We started with a refresher on graph theory, then dove into how GNNs work from a high level. Then we covered some popular GNN implementations and saw how they work in practice.

Deep Generative Models
We investigated the fundamentals of generative modeling, which is a machine learning framework that allows us to learn how to sample new unseen data points that match the distribution of our training dataset. Then we implemented a Denoising Diffusion Model, which is the backbone of the recent and exciting Dalle-2 and Imagen models that we‚Äôve all seen on Twitter.

Transformers & Attention
In this practical, we were introduced to attention in greater detail and build the entire transformer architecture block by block to discover its robustness and powerful architecture.

Bayesian Deep Learning Practical
We explored the basics of Bayesian reasoning with discriminative models. Implement Bayesian linear regression, then delved into more complex models like logistic regression and neural networks. We also learned to implement ‚Äúblack box‚Äù variational inference, a general algorithm for approximate Bayesian inference which can be applied to almost any machine learning model.

Workshop topics
Introduction to causality
Few-shot meta-learning
Array Algebra
Monte Carlo methods 101
Bayesian inference
Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
Introduction to Transformer architecture
Time series models
NLP at Deep Learning Indaba
Optimization in machine learning
AI and Startups
Africa ML and Health Workshop
From Specialists to Generalists: The World of Generalised RL agents
Workshop on Computer Vision

An Afro-feminist Approach to AI Governance and Policy
Trustworthy AI: Bias + Explainable + Interpretable AI
Special highlights
Diversity and inclusion
We are at an important juncture where we must prove to the next generations of any gender, that women really mean business.

Deep Learning Indaba was more than a place to exchange knowledge. It was a place to encourage women and create an environment in which there are no longer any doubts about the ability of women to flourish in the ML field.

Deep Learning Indaba is a great place for African young talents to meet with elite AI researchers and practitioners from the world‚Äôs giant companies, active changemakers, and most impactful communities in Africa.

We were one of the luckiest people to have witnessed the fruitful results of this event and the grandiose impact of its mission.

A big thank you to the Deep Learning Indaba organisers for putting together such a great event ‚ù§

Looking forward to meeting you all again in the next editions,

Indaba Masirouna!

From 2018:
As I sit here in our Airbnb after a week full of positive energy, inclusivity, collaboration and inspiration, I just can‚Äôt help but reflect and digest everything that happened, whether it is on what it meant to go to Deep Learning Indaba (named hereafter DLIndaba) as an InstaDeeper, but also on what this conference meant to me as an African.
As a reference, DLIndaba is THE African Deep Learning conference. First edition was in 2017, and for this year‚Äôs edition, I had the opportunity to attend with one of the greatest teams you could join: InstaDeep.
Press enter or click to view image in full size

InstaDeep at DLIndaba
For a bit of history, I recently joined a Pan-African startup, called InstaDeep. If you‚Äôve been to the DLIndaba, I‚Äôd say that there‚Äôs a 90% chance that you know what I am talking about. For those who don‚Äôt or weren‚Äôt in the conference, InstaDeep is an AI startup that has started in Tunisia, and in a matter of 4 years, expanded in Nairobi, Lagos, London and Paris.
Deep Learning Indaba, so what?
Trust me, DLIndaba is not the most common conference you‚Äôll go to or hear about, and allow me to tell you why.
Indaba‚Äôs aim is to create an inclusive environment where Africans will not be regarded as people seeking for help, but more like people who are able to produce and to be elites in what they do, and more specifically in a field like Machine Learning. Indaba is a group of volunteer organizers who were able to bring together 500 Africans for a week of learning, work showcase, collaboration and rewards.
To make this conference as inclusive as possible, DLIndaba organizers were able to provide more than 200 young Africans with scholarships to join and get the most out of the learning, just like anyone else. With speakers like Jeff Dean, David Silver, Nando De Freitas, Kyunghyun Cho, Moustapha Cisse and Shakir Mohamed, we were certainly served in terms of inspiration, humility, and exchange.
Not only did we have the opportunity to learn from the high level speakers who were invited, but we also could benefit from the meaningful discussions with the participants. Most specifically, I was delighted to go through the posters that showcase the tremendous research work that Africans have been able to deliver.

Rihab, from InstaDeep, presenting her work at DLIndaba
What I usually enjoy about conferences is networking and talking to people, which I consider one of the sources of knowledge and inspiration in gatherings like this since the talks can be too general, repetitive or simply stereotypical after a while.
However, at Indaba, you could find a serious concrete flow of knowledge transfer through well-organized theoretical and practical sessions. Sessions go from basic deep learning fundamentals to probabilistic thinking and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, for theoretical sessions, and even though those were held at a huge auditorium that could easily fit 500+ people, interaction was highly present, with the possibility to simply go to the speaker after the session for a chat.
Bonus point: all of the slides and practicals can be found on the website. Please do enjoy taking a look at those!
Excellence, diversity (the authentic one), and hard work were what characterized Indaba this year. And those are the exact values that InstaDeep goes by.
InstaDeep in all of this?
Well, if I can put the experience as an InstaDeeper in three words, it would be excellence, teamwork and drive.
The teamwork was especially visible during the days and nights leading to Indaba (and during!), in which multiple teams kept working tirelessly to improve the demos and website to make the event a success.

One of the InstaDeep all-nighters, during the conference days
Let me try to summarize the key moments of the experience, as much as I can:
7 posters from InstaDeepers were selected to get showcased during the week of the conference, among which 4 got prizes at the end of it. The top prize, a ticket to NIPS, got awarded by Microsoft to an InstaDeeper, Alaeddine Ayadi.
David Silver even mentioned the team‚Äôs research paper in one of the slides of his talk. The level of excitement at that moment was just unreal!
We were honored to have Jeff Dean (head of Google AI) join us at InstaDeep‚Äôs booth, along with Moustapha Cisse (lead of Google AI in Africa), Andy Volk (Google Ecosystem Lead for Sub-Saharian Africa), and Soonson Kwon (ML GDE Lead).
Someone beat our AI! We were very happy to welcome impressive African AI champions to our booth. We had the pleasure to have interesting discussions, where we could confirm how deeply rooted the talent is in Africa. We also have had them play a game that we prepared for the conference, where humans get to try to beat our AI, and we had a winner! We loved that Tumisho stepped by to get his well-deserved gift.

Conclusion
To sum up, three key points to remember:
It‚Äôs unanimously agreed upon that the team of Indaba organizers surpassed all expectations for this edition. Creating an inspirational ML community in Africa is definitely helping in democratizing what AI means for this continent, preventing and curing several community issues. Those guys are taking this matter seriously and managed to craft a program that answered so many needs in the utmost manner. Kudos to you, DLIndaba team!
None of the above would have happened without the magical link that unites the people of InstaDeep. That goes from those who worked on the logistics of getting 12 people of the company to the conference, to the AI researchers and developers work behind the demos shown at our booth, to the designers who worked hard for the posters to be consistent and attractive, to the developers who worked on our website, to our Unity heroes who could have not made the demos any smoother, and to those who made sure that we kept the good mood, laughter and most importantly fire going around the week! If I have learned something about this last point, it‚Äôs how important people are for a startup. I have certainly just joined, but what I have observed and experienced in the past couple of months is self-explanatory.

Stellenbosch, where the conference was held, is one beautiful town, located around 45 mins away from Cape Town, South Africa. Holding the conference there was certainly meaningful from the history of the university. I can talk for hours about the beauty of this town and of the South Africans‚Äô warmth. In fact, I had the opportunity to meet with the sweetest people ever, Lydia and Cornel who took some time to show me the beauty of the town through the most amazing hike!

For InstaDeep, this is just a small milestone and a reward for the work that the team has been doing lately. But it‚Äôs also the beginning of so much more. As Karim says: ‚ÄúGreat stuff, guys! Exciting times!‚Äù.
Thank you South Africa and Indaba for this energy boost. Now let‚Äôs get back to work.
FROM 2018:
Perhaps the best deep learning meeting I have attended. Heres why.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

Some months ago, I decided to build more experience in core AI and explore its applications in my research domain (HCI). In addition to taking online courses, personal experimentation, sharing expertise, an important part of this journey has been to engage with the community.

And so I was really excited at the opportunity to attend the 2018 deep learning Indaba (Indaba means ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù in Zulu)! My main goals were to learn from the rather high quality speaker panel (Omoju Miller, Naila Murray, Katja Hofmann, David Silver, Kyunghyun Cho, Jeff Dean among many others), learn more about AI for Africa, meet other students/community members and get acquainted with their work. And I was not disappointed!

Most of this post summarizes my notes on talks, panels and practical labs I attended. But first, here are 6 reasons I found the conference very compelling!

#1 The Quality and Depth of Technical Talks, Practicals and Panels
The indaba provided opportunities for in-depth (2hr) talks on important areas within deep learning ‚Äî AI Revolution and its Frontiers by Nando de Freitas (Deepmind, Oxford) Fundamentals of deep learning by Moustapha Cisse (Google AI, Ghana), Convolutional Neural Networks by Naila Murray (Head of Computer Vision Research, Naver Labs), Recurrent Neural Networks by Kyunghun Cho (Professor, NYU), Reinforcement Learning (Katja Hofmann) Success Stories of Deep Learning (David Silver, DeepMind) etc . Most of these lectures allowed presenters to explore fundamental questions, intersperse much appreciated audience interaction (presenter invites audience to speculate on rational behind established practices or provide responses to questions) and address the slew of good questions asked by the audience. Importantly the presenters made themselves available after their presentations for questions/discussions, visited participant poster sessions (gave feedback) and were available to discuss over the conference days!

These topical areas were also followed by practical lab sessions where we walked through code to implement these concepts with additional tasks implemented by participants.

There were also interesting panel discussion sessions covering important topics such as ‚ÄúAI for Africa‚Äù , ‚ÄúMachine Learning in Production‚Äù, ‚ÄúAI Ethics and Policy‚Äù amongst others. I particularly enjoyed the session on ‚ÄúHow to write a good a good research paper‚Äù where Ulrich Paquet, Martin Arjovsky, Stefan Gouws, Kyunghun Cho shared some very good (and sometimes passionate) advice on best practices for research writing both from the writer, and reviewer perspective. Extra points to Ulrich for making us promise to not engage in some dont‚Äôs (don‚Äôt ignore a reviewers feedback, don‚Äôt write without real motivation..) ‚Ä¶ and to Martin for passionately arguing for strong experiments/references to back every claim as well as the removal of all irrelevant proofs or theorems. More details on this panel are provided later.

These are the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôts‚Äù of Machine Learning Research Paper Writing. You must never go there.
#2 The Community and Feeling of Community
There is something inspirational (perhaps magical) about having 550+ conference attendees scurrying between buildings, finding sessions, writing code, listening to talks, and discussing ideas and research opportunities in machine learning. Everyone truly embraced the theme and spirit of the conference ‚Äî Masakhane ‚Äî we build together!

The 2018 Indaba theme is Masakhane. Bringing the African ML/AI/DS community together to learn, share and collaborate. We work to build together across the continent.

It is exciting and impressive what the Deep Learning Indaba organizers have accomplished. Huge credits to that team! It is also remarkable how the subject of Deep Learning has inspired so many within the community ‚Äî such that people are learning independently, conducting experiments and exploring new ideas and areas.

While it was a relatively small conference ‚Äî what struck me was the potential for even greater impact here. As Moustapha Cisse mentioned, Africa has some of the youngest population in the world, providing immense opportunity to really drive change. Furthermore, given that AI is only beginning to take root across Africa, we have the opportunity to do things right from the get go ‚Äî ethical research practices for AI, responsible axiological development of AI and the design of accountability structures that mitigate the negative effects of any (unavoidable) capitalist agenda.

#3 The Opportunities to Discuss Research and Get Feedback
While it is just impossible to talk to everyone, the organization and structure of the conference provided numerous opportunities for this. Daily poster sessions (12.00‚Äì14:00) during lunch period, two social evenings, short interactive activities (discuss concepts with your neighbor) during talks/labs etc. This setup allowed me get some excellent feedback and meaningful discussions while presenting my poster.

In addition, I got to have a serendipitous (and very nice) discussion with two Reinforcement Learning experts at breakfast on Day 4 ‚Äî Katja Hofmann from Microsoft Research Cambridge and David Silver, head of Reinforcement Learning at Deepmind, where they graciously shared their stories and recent work on RL.

They encouraged me to read the book by Sutton and Barto ‚ÄúReinforcement Learning: An Introduction‚Äù. David credits this book as an inspiration for his interest in Reinforcement Learning and Katja mentioned she recommends it to all who are interested in RL.

I will certainly be going through the book over the next few months and if you are interested in RL ‚Ä¶ do so too! The book is available as a free download.

Breakfast meeting with Katja Hofmann, David Silver and fellow attendee Palesa!
The closing social event on Day 5 was also very well organized ‚Äî additional opportunities to discuss, network, enjoy good food and music ‚Ä¶. and dance!


#4 Learning about Compelling Projects in Africa
I was really happy to learn about several research labs conducting research across Africa and also learn about compelling AI projects by students and researchers across universities in Africa. I learned about the SKA telescope hosted in South Africa (one of the largest telescopes in the world) and research which it enables. I learned about H3ABionet ‚Äî a Pan African Bioinformatics network comprising 32 Bioinformatics research groups distributed amongst 15 African countries and 2 partner Institutions based in the USA. These units support H3Africa researchers and their projects (genomic , demographic, disease, data collection etc) while developing Bioinformatics capacity within Africa. I also got to see numerous interesting student/researcher posters spanning applications in Deep Learning for plant disease detection, Reinforcement Learning for addressing bin packing problems (instadeep), Generation of drug molecules for curing diseases using GANs etc. A set of interesting spotlight talks in the computer vision domain can be found here.

It was also inspirational to see the award winning projects (Kambule and Maathai award) and all the other research projects that got awards from Google, NVIDIA, IBM and Microsoft. Huge congratulations to all the winners!

Given all of the above progress being made, a consensus notion throughout the conference was that the contributions so far are meaningful but small compared to the overall opportunity.

#5 Beautiful Stellenbosch
It was my first time in South Africa and I was pleasantly surprised by the rather exquisite landscape on the drive from Cape Town airport to the conference venue at Stellenbosch. Changing scenery of fields, vineyards, hills/mountains and lots of trees/green. While I did not have much time to visit much of the countryside, I found the Stellenbosch university campus to be both beautiful and very well appointed.

6# The TPUs
During Jeff Dean‚Äôs talk (in true Oprah style), he mentioned that all conference attendees would be provided with access to Google‚Äôs research cloud - 5 regular TPUs and 20 preemptible TPUs per person for the next few months. Thank you Google! This gesture is really impactful as access to compute can be a major limitation, particularly for independent researchers working within small groups across Africa. It is great to see this level of support from large companies, and I am really excited to see the range of research results that this will enable.

Edit: I did build a project generating African Mask Art with TPUs which has inspired many similar explorations.

On the flight from CapeTown to Johannesburg. Goodbyes are hard.
At the end of the conference, saying goodbyes was hard ‚Äî a testament to the strength of the community (someone actually told me it felt like the end of summer camp where everyone felt warm and fuzzy ‚Ä¶ and sad the camp was over). However, I think Shakir (one of the organizers) got it spot on when he mentioned in his closing remarks that the real work starts when we all go back to our institutions and engage in high quality research ‚Äî this is what will build up and truly elevate the community.

I found the talks to be excellent, the labs to be useful in getting familiar with (or refreshed on) implementing NNs and the panels to be illuminating.

Feedback: The one area which I think would be good to cover in a future Deep Learning Indaba is related to exploring the UX of AI deployments in Africa ‚Äî with a focus on training and deploying models on resource constrained devices. This is critical, especially given that most users within Africa only have access to such devices. I had a brief chat with Sarah Hooker who also mentioned model quantization as an interesting focus area! I look forward to helping out with a session that helps address this.

I absolutely look forward to attending the event again next year ‚Äî Deep Learning Indaba 2019, Kenya!

Notes from Sessions, Labs and Panels
A collection of notes taken during sessions, labs and panels as well as links to resources.

Day 1: Practical Machine Learning Basics
Lab | Mathematics for Machine Learning | Github

Talk | Mathematics for Machine Learning | Avishkar Bhoopchand, Deepmind | Slides | lecture notes
This talk covered important areas of mathematics relevant for machine learning.‚Äî probability theory and bayesian inference, linear algebra, matrix decomposition, differentiation, optimization, integration, functional analysis. Probability distributions ‚Äî (how likely it is for a random variable to take on a one of several values). Bernouli, binomial, Gaussian, etc. Joint probability, marginal probability, conditional probability etc. Differentiation and integration. Sum, product, chain rules. Jacobian vectors and matrices.

Day 2: Deep Learning Fundamentals, Feed Forward Models, Convolutional Models.
Talk | Deep Learning Fundamentals | Moustapha Cisse

This was a really interesting talk and what I got out of it was some really clear explanations and intuitions behind common decisions in DL practice. These explanations were enabled by the great set of questions asked during the talk. Why SGD instead of analytical approaches to solving for regression coefficients (matrix invertibility, computation costs, lack of closed form solutions)? Why NNs (some functions are not linearly separable)? Why not not explore preprocessing steps that make such functions linearly separable? Why large models (theoretical results that show shallow models need exponentially large parameters to represent some functions, and results that show it is easier to optimize larger models due to the shape/landscape of such models)? Why do RELUs perform better (they are non-saturating activation functions and this helps address gradient vanishing)? Why and when to use which optimizer (Adam works well for datasets which contain rare events)?

Lab | Feed Forward Networks | Github
The tutorial covered concepts on building a multi layer neural network for classifying fashion MNIST data (Tensorflow Eager and Keras). I found the tasks in implementing DropOut and BatchNorm to address overfitting issues to be an excellent refresher on these concepts.

Day 3: Convolutional Networks, Probabilistic Thinking, Recurrent Models.
Lab | Convolutional Neural Networks | Github

This lab included tasks on the impact of initialization schemes for convnets (Xavier, He, Glorot initialization) and the simple plot_model keras method for visualizing a model (handy for papers etc).

Talk | Convolutional Networks | Naila Murray (Naver Labs) ‚Äî
Convnets are used to process data with meaningful local relationships. Motivations for using CNNs ‚Äî allows for sparse connectivity, parameter sharing, translation equivariance, arbitrary input sizes.

Talk | Probabilistic Thinking | Yabebal Fantaye,

First quick task ‚Äî ‚ÄúAn urn contains 5 red balls and 7 green balls. First draw is done without disclosure. Second is disclosed. Does probability of first change with knowledge of the second?‚Äù. Probably can be viewed in terms of syntax (objective universally true notation) and semantics (interpretation based on either frequentist or bayesian views). There is no probability without condition.
Under what conditions is p(x|y) > p (x)? When there are correlations between both variables e.g. probability of wearing a jacket is greater if it is raining (condition y) than base probably of wearing a jacket.

Bayes theorem | p(x|y) = p(y|x) p(x) / p(y).

Talk | Text Classification | Kyunghun Cho (NYU)

Prof. Cho‚Äôs talk covered concepts related to training neural networks and language modeling; discussions on Softmax as a generalization of a benoulli distribution; back-propagation as a case of maintaining and managing jakobian vectors/matrices; early stopping close to the solution of the minimization problem to avoid overfitting (especially with SGD and large datasets). He also covered formulations where CNNs+ RNNs are used for SOTA NMT and language modeling tasks. An interesting recommendation was that it was better for performance to train an embedding from scratch if we have enough data. He also covered character based models, their expressivity and superior performance for handling new tokens within translation tasks.

Panel | How to write a good research paper | Slides
Martin Ajovsky, Stefan Gouws, Kyunghun Cho, Ulrich Paquet.

Below are a list of important points from the panelists:

Simon Peyton Jones ‚Äî How to write a great research paper.
Write before starting the experiments. Experiments should be done to put evidence on the claims. So formulate the claims first.
Good writing is good editing. Writing is more of an iterative task. Write out the idea, distribute the ideas and get feedback.
The entire paper should tell One story. Repeat this in the abstract, repeat it in the introduction, run experiments to support this claim, repeat claim in conclusion. Across the paper, follow up on this one story.
Figures: All papers should have one main figure that encapsulate the main message in the paper. All figures and tables must have self explanatory captions. E.g. Figure X is a table of model performance; we can see on the top right that the xx model performs better (bolden).
Preschedule a paper swapping session e.g. 3‚Äì5 days before the deadline. Getting early feedback is important.
Treasure feedback from reviewers. Some authors dont adopt feedback and resubmit same unrevised paper to a new venue. Bad form.
Dont ask to be an author unless you have really contributed at least 5% of the work.
Research results must be falsifiable ‚Äî add benchmarks, tests etc and strong evaluation.
Let the motivation be real. Do not simply adopt a generic motivation such as ‚ÄúNeural networks are popular so we use it too‚Äù.
Care about the readers mental model ‚Äî what does the reader understand up until this point ‚Ä¶ what is the reader thinking? what is on their mind? how will my next narrative change that? Don‚Äôt switch notation, do not use notation that is not defined or defined later in the paper.
You can create your own benchmarks or baselines for some tasks that are novel. This is ok.
Writing should be a daily habit. Writing IS research ..
Best papers are completed long before the deadline. Two weeks before the deadline, send to critics and then integrate feedback. The best papers are the ones that have been heavily critiqued and sometimes resubmitted after a revision/rejection.
Ask yourself .. what have I learned from the paper, or what can people reuse from this paper? How can this paper make people imagine or gain new ideas?
Don‚Äôt assume reviewers are experts in your field. Be clear and bring your message across in the clearest way as possible. Reviewers have a short amount of time ~1hr ? In the end, reviewers may be looking to answer the question ‚Äî ‚Äúhow can I justify rejecting this paper‚Äù? Don‚Äôt make it easy for them.
While it is tempting, avoid telling story of the journey within the paper ‚Äî skip to the main points. Science is a random walk. However, report the shortest path.
Unlike traditional prose, research writing should have no surprises ‚Äî every important concept should be presented upfront.
Never make any claim that is not directly validated by a theorem, experiment or a reference. If you claim something is a problem, experimentally show this! More claims is not always better.
Highlight problems and negative results. Remove meaningless proofs.
Day 4.: Generative Models, Reinforcement Learning
Talk | Reinforcement Learning (RL)| Katja Hoffman

RL is focused on decision making and learning under uncertainty. How agents can make decisions under uncertain environments. Early RL was inspired by optimal control problems.There are relationships between RL and neurological phenomena e.g dopamine neurons firing represents the brain‚Äôs way of modeling a reward signal (Schultz et al 1997).

Formalizing RL: we need a common language to describe a wide variety of problems. Agent (takes actions A) within an environment (provides states S). Relationship between agent and environment proceeds in time steps. Reward is information agent receives that can used to update their decision policy p(a|s).

The RL process is represented by a Markov Decision Process ‚Ä¶ M = (S,A,P,R,Œ≥). It adheres to the Markov property (dynamics only depend on the most recent state and action.). Discount parameter Œ≥ allows a weighted effect on rewards (recent rewards have more weight).

Day 5: Non-Recurrent Sequence Models, Frontiers of CV, AI for Africa
Panel | AI for Africa | Nyalleng Moorosi, Moustapha Cisse, Linet Kwamboka, Jon Lenchner, Sumir Panji.

Panelists discussed their work across the African continent.

Nyalleng identified interesting areas ‚Äî data science with a focus on Africa. Data for science (biosciences, energy, natural resources, defense), Data science for gov (municipalities, SMEs, ), data science for education and advocacy (workshops, training etc)

Linet Kwamboka highlighted limiations of AI (cultural images vs indecent content?), limitations in langauges translations. She also showed examples of how incorrect translations can have serious consequences (e.g. on an official website of Sudan, a title containing the word Sudan was incorrectly translated as ‚ÄúIndia‚Äù).

Jon Lenchner gave an overview of IBM projects across the African continent. He mentioned IBM explores the most pressing problems, adopting machine learning approaches only where appropriate. He mentioned projects that used airtime top off pattern to model credit score rating; studies on correlation between malaria gene and breast cancers; using DL to speed up the management of cancer records etc.

Sumir detailed the fascinating work done by Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa). The institution served to facilitate a contemporary research approach for the study of genomics and environmental determinants of common diseases with the goal of improving the health in Africa. H3africa.net is composed of 15 collaborative centers, with 48 funded H3Africa projects; with over 170 Million USD invested. H3Africa projects include data collection for phenotype data, demographic information, anthropometric data, disease and health related phenotype data. These can be found at Biorepository.h3africa.net. Sumir also mention a machine learning based project from H3ABionet led by Dr Amel Ghouila from Institute Pasteur Tunis. The ML project covers the development of training materials, handbooks, platforms, tools and packages. Sumir mentioned progress is sometimes held back by lack of collaboration ‚Äî scientists see data as the currency for publications and are reluctant to share.

There was also a group discussion session period where participants shared ideas on potential ripe project areas in the AI domain ‚Äî AI for personalized education, AI to support mental health issues, projects around data collection and sharing efforts, AI for payments (transparency etc).

Talk | Success Stories in Deep Reinforcement Learning | David Silver (Deepmind) | Slides

David gave an overview of important RL projects over the last few years.


Design an agent that can solve any human-level task. Reinforcement learning defines the objective. Deep learning gives the mechanisms.
DL In Practice: We use NNs to represent the value function , policy or model of RL. After this we optimize the loss function end-to-end.
First success story: TD Backgammon. Tesauro 1992
Mnih 2014 DQN on Atari. Can we learn a model that learns to generalize across multiple games? Goal was to maximize the score given the pixels. Modeled using CNNs. Represent value function by a q-network with weights w.
AlphaGo. The search space is exponential for the game of go. Address this by training a policy network (predict the next move with confidence) and a value network (understand and evaluate the state and board position). Initial phase used supervised learning from examples or experts.
AlphaZero explores updates to Alphago ‚Äî no human examples etc repeated learning from self play, monte carlo tree search. Trained for 8 hours on several thousand TPUs. Examples of strategies selected by AlphaZero showed it discovered some common opening moves which it later discarded for more complex strategies it discovered.
Dota2 ‚Äî Multi agent domains with DeepRL.
David also introduced (for the first time) his 10 principles for RL.
Panel | NLP Frontiers Panel | Sebastian Ruder, Herman Kamper, Stefan Gouws, Jade Abbot, Omoju Miller

This panel started with Sebastian Ruder giving an overview of important NLP work over the last few years.

Open Problems in NLP: Based on a survey from NLP experts, the set of problem areas were summarized as ‚Äî Natural Language understanding, NLP for low resource scenarios, Reasoning about large or multiple documents, Dataset problems and Evaluation.

An interesting idea that was also discussed was related to unsupervised speech recognition via alignment and unsupervised language modeling. These include methods for mapping/morphing embedding space across languages without parallel texts ‚Äî e.g. train corpus in different languages, project into a latent embedding space and use known words to align both spaces. We can use this alignment information for document/topic classification and sentiment analysis; however it is too imprecise for language translation.

From 2018:
During the week of the 9th ‚Äî 14th of September 2018 I was blessed with the opportunity to attend the Deep Learning Indaba 2018 held in Stellenbosch, South Africa. The Deep Learning Indaba is a week-long conference that ‚Äúexists to celebrate and strengthen machine learning in Africa‚Äù. It is a wonderful gathering of Machine Learning Researchers, Practitioners and Enthusiasts from all walks of life who share in the collective vision that Africans are and will continue to be ‚Äúcritical contributors, owners and shapers of the coming advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning‚Äù.

The theme of this years Indaba was Masakhane ‚Äî We Build Together. Keep this theme in mind as you read through this post. By the end you will have a better understanding of the significance of the theme as well as (hopefully) a new, refreshed, or affirmed perspective on what it means to be African.

Note: this blog post will not be a technical deep-dive. Rather, this post will cover several key takeaways which I walked away with from the Indaba.

Here‚Äôs how the week went‚Ä¶

Day-to-day Walkthrough
Day 1
Entering the main conference hall for the first time, I found myself feeling a bit anxious and overwhelmed by the crowds and the week ahead. This anxiety was quickly dispelled when Nando de Freitas, Principle Scientist and Team Lead at DeepMind, kicked off the event with a welcoming Keynote that left the 500+ attendees inspired, energised and excited about the week ahead. Nando left the audience with several wise words:

Where there‚Äôs a problem, there‚Äôs an opportunity to do something great.
Don‚Äôt ever say that a problem cannot be solved.
Ideas are not born out of the blue ‚Äî you have to develop a strong sense of curiosity.
He was then followed by Moustapha Cisse, Team Lead of Google AI in Ghana, and Naila Murray, Senior Scientist at Naver Labs in Europe, who covered the Fundamentals of Deep Learning and Convolutional Models respectively. Moustapha humorously (but quite seriously) stressed that as a Data Science practitioner, you only earn the right to use a Deep Learning framework (Tensorflow, Keras, etc) once you‚Äôve gone through the pain of implementing neural networks from scratch at least once.


*(Charles H Martin, 2018)

One thing that was quite apparent to me was that all of the speakers (including those I would later come to see) were not only exceptionally knowledgable in their technical fields, but they were excellent communicators who made it easy for audiences to consume knowledge. This is a beautiful skill to have!

Day 2
Day 2 began with an awesome lab session on Convolutional Neural Networks where we got to implement a basic image classifier. This was then followed a technical lecture by Yabedal Fantaye, Junior Research Chair at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in South Africa. Yabedal‚Äôs lecture showed how probabilistic thinking is at the heart of Machine Learning because Machine Learning attempts to model data under uncertainty. This stats-heavy session brought out some of my old insecurities as stats and I have never quite gotten along.

Kyunghyun Cho, Assistant Professor at New York University and Research scientist at Facebook AI Research, followed Yabedal with a lecture on Recurrent Neural Networks. Mr. Cho went through the mechanics of Recurrent Neural Networks in a humorous but clear fashion, and he opened my mind to just how massive a field Language Modelling is with particularly useful applications which tackle pressing problems such as breaking down educational barriers through automatic language translation. Day 2 concluded with a lab session on Recurrent Neural Networks where we got to implement a Recurrent Neural Network for time-series estimation and a Recurrent Language Model for character level classification.

Day 3
Shakir Mohamed, Research Scientist at DeepMind, kicked off Day 3 with a lecture on Generative Models. His session was focussed on strengthening probabilistic foundations, where he stressed the fact that all Machine Learning practitioners must build ‚ÄòProbabilistic Dexterity‚Äô.


*(Pbworks, 2014)

This session was followed by the Kambule and Maathai Awards Session ‚Äî an inspirational awards session which recognises excellent machine learning research and application being done by Africans. This session was particularly special because it celebrated African Machine Learning ‚Äî Machine Learning being used to positively impact African societies. The Kambule and Maathai awards were awarded to Dr. Justine Nasejje and Yasini Musa Ayami. I urge you to see what great work they have done to enhance the African Machine Learning body of knowledge and to uplift their communities. What particularly stood out for me in this session was seeing that the African continent is exploding with talent and has a lot more brewing. Machine Learning can and is being used to uplift communities throughout Africa. You don‚Äôt need to be the smartest person or have the smartest idea to make a positive difference. You just need to embed yourself at the heart of the problems which you‚Äôre trying to solve.

The remainder of the day was dedicated to Reinforcement Learning which was covered by Katja Hofmann, Researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge. Katja took us through the foundations of Reinforcement Learning as well how she currently uses the game Minecraft as an experimentation platform to develop intelligent technologies.

Day 4
For attendees wanting to dive deeper into the technicals of certain fields, 3 parallel tracks were hosted in the morning of Day 4. I attended the session titled the ‚ÄòFrontiers of Computer Vision‚Äô. This session walked through the history of Computer Vision and how it has developed over the years. We were then fortunate to watch presentations by a select few who are using Computer Vision to solve very interesting and complex problems. Two particularly useful use cases stood out for me wherein Computer Vision was being applied to healthcare problems such as Breast Cancer detection and Early Retinal Tissue Damage Detection.

Following the parallel sessions, a thought-provoking panel discussion was held on Democratising Machine Learning on the African Continent. Truth be told, this topic itself needs a separate blog post to explore its depth but I‚Äôll do my best to summarise the conversation. This discussion explored how Machine Learning can, is being, and should be democratised on the African Continent. Key takeaways from this discussion:

Access to internet and computing power are the two most important things needed in order to democratise Machine Learning on the African continent.
African countries should not be concerned about brain drain. In an increasingly digitally connected world, there should be no reason why you cannot add value to a place remotely.
Those with skills and resources need to drive localised education and skills development in their communities to develop talent. Africa must not be afraid of exporting it‚Äôs talent to the rest of the world.
Africa needs practical Machine Learning ‚Äî moving beyond ideation to delivery and execution.
This conversation turned out to be very lively and interactive with the panelists tackling some sensitive topical issues, leading me to believe that they truly are thought leaders in this space.

David Silver, a celebrity in the Machine Learning fraternity, delivered a special session on the success stories of Reinforcement Learning. He is a Principle Scientist at DeepMind and was also the lead researcher on the AlphaGo team responsible for defeating the worlds best human Go player in 2016.

Day 4 was concluded with 3 parallel tracks. I attended a session on Generative Models and Healthcare facilitated by Konstantina Palla, Research Scientist at Microsoft Research Cambridge. One thing that stood out for me from this session was how carefully one has to frame a Machine Learning problem in the context of Healthcare. This is because of the sensitive nature of the work being done e.g disease detection and diagnosis. You cannot trust a Machine Learning model blindly in such contexts without truly understanding what your model is doing.

Day 5
In an unfortunate ‚Äòturn‚Äô of events (car accident), I wasn‚Äôt able to attend any of the morning sessions on the final day, but I made it just in time to catch the tail end of another Machine Learning celebrity‚Äôs talk: Jeff Dean ‚Äî Senior Fellow, Google AI. Google Brain lead and co-founder. Co-designer and implementor of Tensorflow, MapReduce, BigTable, and Spanner (seriously, what hasn‚Äôt this guy done?). At the end of his talk, Jeff Dean was asked ‚ÄúHow have you done so much?‚Äù, to which he replied (and I‚Äôm paraphrasing here) ‚ÄúFind an area you don‚Äôt know about which you want to know about. Then find people in that area who you can learn from and work with. Collaborate.‚Äù Hearing this I began doing some deeper reflection on the Indaba over the week and two values stood out for me as my biggest takeaways.

Empathy and Humility
Let me reiterate: over 500 people from all over the world gathered together for a week because of a collective vision ‚Äî Africans are and will continue to be ‚Äúcritical contributors, owners and shapers of the coming advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning‚Äù. Every one of the attendees at the Indaba this year has, in some way or another, taken it upon themselves to embed themselves at the heart of the challenges being faced in their fields of research, places of work, and communities ‚Äî that‚Äôs empathy! With empathy at their core, every attendee came with a thirst for knowledge, knowing that there‚Äôs so much out there to be learnt. Everyone was ready to work with and learn from others ‚Äî That‚Äôs humility! Coupled together, empathy and humility form an unbreakable chain of collaboration that can span across the African continent ultimately helping people to live better. That is Masakhane!
